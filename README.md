## Grumble - Tinder For Restaurants

A project for a software engineering class where we developed a restaurant-finding app with a Tinder-like interface. Features include:

- **Signup/Signin Page:** With email confirmation.
- **Location/Filter Page:** Uses Google Maps API for user location and allows filtering by price, categories, and open status.
- **Integration with Yelp API:** Fetches a list of nearby restaurants based on user filters.
- **Tinder-like Interface:** Users can swipe through restaurant options and save favorites for later viewing.

### Team Contributions
- **Rishab (Backend):** Developed app flows using Python and Django, created HTML files for app views, and handled complex backend integrations like database operations using JavaScript.
- **Maha (Frontend):** Handled all styling and visual elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
