# Grumble - CS-411-Project
Grumble - Tinder For Restaurants 

A simple project for a software engineering class. In this project we implemented a Signup/Signin page with a confirmation email. Then after that we implemented a location/filter page in which 
we hit the google maps api to get the longitude and latitude for a users location. Then we ask for more filters (such as price, categories(of restaurants), and whether its open right now), with
all this information we then hit the yelp api to get a list of retaurants in the vicinity. We then display these restaurants in a tinder like fashion. Users can flick through these results with a skip button. If they wish to save a restaurant for later they can do that, and they view saved restaurants in a different view.

Rishab - Backend (Python(DJANGO Projects/App))
created the flows for the app and made simple html files associated for them. 
For more complex functions that required backend integration (eg deleting/saving to sql database) wrote javescript.

API key is visible for simplicities till the project is done.

Maha - Frontend (Html CSS)
Did all the styling and Visual elements of the website using CSS, HTML and Javascript
